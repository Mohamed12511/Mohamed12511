<br/>

- I’ve solved over **800 problems on Codeforces** and **200+ on LeetCode**, constantly pushing my logic and thinking abilities.
- My handle: [Mohamed_Osama1](https://codeforces.com/profile/Mohamed_Osama1) on Codeforces | [mohamed60111](https://leetcode.com/mohamed60111) on LeetCode.
- I participated in **ECPC** and I'm preparing hard to enter the next regional competitions and ICPC.
- I specialize in **diving deep into problem analysis**, thinking in **optimal complexity**, and constantly trying harder problems.
- I enjoy solving **constructive algorithms**, **data structures**, **binary search**, **greedy**, **math**, and **graph theory**.
- I focus every day on practicing not just quantity, but quality — I reflect on every problem, learn from upsolving, and strengthen my weak points.
- My mindset in CP: **consistency beats intensity** — every day matters.
- My goal: Reach **Candidate Master** by the end of 2025 and solve **1000+ problems**.

## 🧱 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Foundation of Structure

- I deeply understand **classes, objects, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation**.
- OOP gives me the ability to write **scalable**, **modular**, and **maintainable code**.
- I build practice projects in C++ using **inheritance trees**, **virtual methods**, and **real-world analogies**.
- I'm building the habit of solving CP problems using **OOP style and data abstraction**.
- Understanding OOP helps me dive deeper into **backend development**, **API design**, and **system structure**.
  
🧱 *“OOP teaches me how to think like an engineer, not just a coder.”*

---

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms – Backbone of Problem Solving

- I’ve mastered **arrays, stacks, queues, linked lists, hash maps**, and **heaps**.
- Solved numerous problems on **binary search**, **two-pointers**, **recursion**, **greedy**, **DP**, and **graphs**.
- I track performance and time complexity in every solution.
- I often **implement data structures from scratch** in C++ to understand how they truly work under the hood.

📦 *“DSA isn't a topic, it's a lifetime skill.”*

## 🌐 Networking – Understanding How the Web Works

- I’m learning the **OSI Model**, **TCP/IP**, **HTTP/HTTPS**, **DNS**, and **routing principles**.
- I understand **IP addressing**, **subnetting**, and **client-server architecture**.
- I practice using tools like **Postman** and simulate requests.
- I'm interested in how **networking concepts affect performance**, especially in APIs and backend systems.

🌐 *“Networking teaches me how systems truly communicate — beyond just code.”*

---

## 💾 Databases – Core of Data Management

- I’ve worked with **MySQL** and **MongoDB** — designing schemas and writing queries.
- Learned **CRUD**, **indexes**, **joins**, **aggregation**, and **query optimization**.
- Practicing **relational vs non-relational models**, and building small apps using Node.js + MongoDB.
- Interested in building **scalable backend architectures** with good DB design.

💾 *“Databases store the future — if you design them wrong, the system collapses.”*

---

## 🧮 Operating Systems – Core Concepts

- I understand how **CPU scheduling**, **memory management**, **multithreading**, **deadlocks**, and **file systems** work.
- I study how the OS **manages resources**, prioritizes tasks, and interacts with hardware.
- These concepts help me write **efficient programs** and understand how code translates into execution.

🧠 *“Knowing OS helps me move from just writing code to understanding execution.”*
